# Environment variables

The vast majority of configurations for the environment are stored
in `config_${user}.sh`. You can manipulate the values of some
environment variables with allowed values as in this table and it is
recommended modifying or adding variables in `config_${user}.sh` config
file instead of exporting them in the shell. By doing that, it is
assured that they are persisted.
